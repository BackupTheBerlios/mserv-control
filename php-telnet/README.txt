What is this ??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This is a web frontend for the (very nice) mserv program, a program 
  which turns your linux server into a mp3 juke box with plenty of features.
  You can get it at
      http://www.mserv.org


Install
~~~~~~~

  To install, extract all files into a directory and change the 
  settings in "config.inc.php" according to our needs.
  Start with "start.php" or rename it to "index.php"
  
  Be sure to have mserv running (adjust the host and port settings
  int the config file if necessary).
  

What is left to do ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - (much) better error checking
  - design
  - some functions not implemented yet

  
Misc.

  You can always get the latest version of this nice frontend at
      http://www.ohardt.com
